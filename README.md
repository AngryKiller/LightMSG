# LightMSG
LightMSG is a private messaging plugin that I written a long time ago because I wanted to learn Java and make Minecraft plugins. I'm not developping or supporting it anymore, and I didn't tested it for a long time but it should still work on any Minecraft server that supports Bukkit 1.8+ without any problems. You can fork it if you want following the license.
